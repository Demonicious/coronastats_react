                <h2><span class="red">Coronastats</span> has shifted over to <span class="blue">React.js</span></h2>
                <br>
                <p>Many users reported that they were facing issues regarding the poor-performance of the website.<br><br>I was aware of this because, When I started development of this app.. The data-sets weren't really that big.<br>So I didn't bother to use "good coding practices" in my application, Which has been a catastrophic decision.<br>The data-sets became bigger and bigger, and the site couldn't keep up..<br><br>The site was built using Plain JavaScript with a little bit of jQuery. jQuery is a very old library and isn't recommended anymore, but I figured It'd be fine for the job... I was wrong!<br><br>Keeping this in mind, I decided to re-create the entire website using <span class="blue">React.js</span> which is a very popular<br>Front-end Building Library. I chose <span class="blue">React</span> because I was aware of it's many advantages in Single-page-apps & also that It would speed up developemnt time by a lot.</p>
